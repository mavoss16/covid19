# covid19
Repository containing Iowa statewide and county data on Covid-19 and R code for analysis

### Notes
Data for 8-16 includes testing data from 8-10 through 8-16. This is due to the derecho that swept through Iowa and left the database maintainer without power for nearly a week. Because of this, the 14 day rolling average of test date is more of a 14 period rolling average, because the 8-16 data includes a full week's worth of data. This likely will not be fixed, but will fix itself starting 8-30.
